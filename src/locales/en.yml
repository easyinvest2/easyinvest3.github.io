  title: Frequently asked Questions
  q1:
    question: <big>W</big></big>hat are the guarantees that I will receive my interest?
    answer: The project smart contract is deployed into the Ethereum blockchain. It is fully automated.
      The contract creator does not have access to the code and data. It is not even clear who the creator is.
      The contract can not be changed or deleted. Funds that are stored on the contract account are 
      managed exclusively a simple and reliable program that makes payments. Code of the program
      guarantees permanent payments. You can see
      <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc668652d40e2b236969a9c2d28f4b23ed23da077"> the code </a>
      and verify it or ask community members on <a href="https://t.me/SmartEasyInvestEN">telegram channel</a>.
  q2:
    question: <big><big>H</big></big>ow long will I receive payouts?
    answer: The smart contract code guarantees payouts as long as the fund has money. It may be veeery long time.
      Remember that all 100% of deposits go to payouts so no single wei (the smallest part of ETH) will be lost.
  q3:
    question: <big><big>W</big></big>hy choose this project?
    answer: '<ul>
                <li><big><b>Simple and honest contract</b></big><br/>
                This contract has the simplest, the most honest and therefore the most relible source code,
                   which is available for review by anyone.
                </li>
                <li><big><b>No owner</b></big><br/>
                The contract does not have owner, the contract creators are just ordinary investors. Is this not the best proof of its reliability?
                </li>
                <li><big><b>All money to investors!</b></big><br/>
                This is the only contract without any extra comissions. All the 100% deposits go to payouts. Therefore you will earn more.
                </li>
                <li><big><b>Maximum payouts</b></big><br/>
                Thanks to zero comissions the payouts are 4% of your deposit daily!    
                </li>
                <li><big><b>Full autonomy</b></big><br/>
                You can withdraw you interest at any time by yourself. Just by sending 0 ETH transaction to the smart contract address. Regardless of anything!
                </li> 
            </ul>'
  q4:
    question: <big><big>W</big></big>hat will happen if project creators stop supporting the project?
    answer: It is the people`s contract, that is, the creators unable to stop support becase there are no any creators :)
      And if they were they do not have access to contract anyway - the contract is absolutely automatic. 
      Therefore the contract will continue working in any circumstances.
  q5:
    question: <big><big>I</big></big>s there a referral program?
    answer: '<p>
                No, because we believe that referral programs are just waste of investor`s money.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the contract does work good you receive large interest for your deposit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Involve others to participate in the project without a referral link - and you will receive your interest much longer!
            </p>'
  q6:
    question: <big><big>W</big></big>hy is the contract called people`s?
    answer: '<p>
               Initially it was called Easy Invest and had a developer. As once Bitcoin had the developer Satosi Nakamoto. 
               This developer made a completely autonomous contract, threw a couple of links at the forums and ... gone!
               Over time, all messages from this developer have disappeared from the forums.
               It is known that one of the first investments in this contract was the developer`s contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then the contract existed on its own. Possessing the uniqueness, brevity, simplicity and honesty of its code,
                like Bitcoin, he literally draws people to him. After a short time without advertising, on the word of mouth 
                the contract demonstrated a significant growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since there are no administrative roles in the contract, it is independently formed around it a
                community of people who liked the quality and honesty of this contract. In comparison to other similar projects,
                where despotism of admins reigns, investors are encumbered with huge commissions, and complex contracts contain bugs,
                Easy Invest looks very good. Thanks to its simplicity, quality, honesty and democracy, people have named
                Easy Invest a truly people`s and revolutionary contract.
                Repeating the fate of once abandoned Bitcoin, Easy Invest`s people`s contract can also affect the world as much.
                And now you have a chance to join the community of the people`s revolutionary contract!
            </p>
            <p>
                It remains only to guess who was the original developer of this people`s contract. Who knows, maybe it`s Satoshi
                Nakamoto returned and gave us another miracle? :)
            </p>'
  q7:
    question: <big><big>W</big></big>ho is developing this project then?
    answer: '<p>
                People. All the forums, telegram groups, reviews - everything is made by ordinary investors, the same as you are.
            </p>
            <p>
                The initial site template (do you like our site?) was presented by formerly competing project. It was discontinued short after 
                and its developers had probably found more profitable to become ordinary investors of the people`s contract.
            </p>
            <p>
                Joining people`s contract you also become the member of a community and gain right to equally participate 
                in its development and promotion!
            </p>'
  q8:
    question: <big><big>T</big></big>he advertisement budget is 0? Won`t the project die?
    answer: '<p>
              No. Quite the opposite, we are afraid it grows up too fast! The fact is that when
              power and money belongs to the admins, then only a few people work on the project`s support and promotion. There
              can also work a whole army of referrals (again, for the money of investors), but noone believes them, because it immediately becomes
              clear that they are just selling their referral link. As a result, people feel faked and do not get involved into projects 
              that are managed by a group of greedy admins.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the people`s contract, everything is much better. The whole community is united by the 
              primordial equality and fairness of honest smart contract that does not divide people into admins and investors.
              As a result, everyone feels responsible for the contract and the project is promoted by everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not necessary to go too far for the evidence. With advertising costs of 0%, the people`s contract has long had overtaken
              many "admin-owned" complex projects that waste "on advertising and referrals" up to 30% of the investors money.
            </p>
            <p>
               Therefore, joining the people`s contract, you get a community with the best progress without any
              commissions from your hard-earned investments. Of course, we must remember that as part of the community, 
               you too can help other people, informing them that there is such a significant event in the world as a people`s contract.
               And people will be grateful, and your payments will last much longer.
            </p>'
  q9: 
    question: <big><big>W</big></big>hy does the site says that INVESTED XXX, and the contract has only YYY?
    answer: Because the site shows the total sum invested without taking into account requested payments. The contract balance is 
      the sum of deposits minus requested payments. Accordingly, the difference in the amount of investments 
      from the site and the amount on the contract is equal to the amount of payments already made
